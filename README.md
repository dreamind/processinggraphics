processinggraphics
==================

A node.js wrapper to processingjs to provide a seamless support to both server/client side processingjs.
Currently supporting processingjs (client side), pdf, png, and jpg (server side).

To run the demo, call the server app:

    node app.js

After running the app, call:

    node test.js

This should generate test.pdf, test.jpg, and test.png.
